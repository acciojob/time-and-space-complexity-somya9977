	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is used to measure how efficient an algorithm is by calculating the amount of time it takes to run as the input size grows. Understanding Time complexity helps developers choose an efficient solution for a given problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. Space Complexity is often expressed using notations like O(n), which represents how memory usage grows with input size.
